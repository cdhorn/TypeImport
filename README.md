# Type Import Tool

This is a simple tool that registered under the Tools -> Utilities menu that allows the user to import a Gramps types export previously generated with the Type Export Tool.

It will read in the json, check that it is what it thinks it is, and then merge the types and attributes in it with the current ones for the current database.
